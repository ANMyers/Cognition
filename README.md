# Cognition
##About
This was my Front End Capstone for [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com/). I built this application in memory of my grandmother, she was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was a teenager. I remember seeing her under tremendous amounts of stress when she had her bio sample taken for a diagnosis and I wanted a way to help. I wanted a way for her to start preparing for the most likely outcome before recieving her results so I built Cognition. Without much of a mathematical background I tried my best to build a machine learning application that a user can read about how the algorithm works, see the algorithm run, and then see a real world application of that algorithm.

##Description
Front End Capstone utilizing [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) breast cancer dataset to build a machine learning application for predicting malignant or benign breast cancer bio samples.
